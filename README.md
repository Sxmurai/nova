A 1.8.9 Hypixel client

---

To all that are wondering:

> Wait Gavin, aren't you against Hypixel cheating?

Yeah, I think it's fucking stupid. So then, why am I making this? I was bored, and I saw a few videos about Hypixel cheating where they were BLATENTLY hacking, and watchdog did NOTHING about it. Pissed me off, so I decided to make this to see how easy it is.

I am and always will be more of an Anarchy client developer, but yeah. It's crazy how Watchdog is a NCP base (iirc) and it's that shit. My god.
